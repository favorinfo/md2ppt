Six Feet Up Themed Landslide
============================

See also https://github.com/adamzap/landslide

Install
-------

install landslide inside a virtualenvwrapper::

  $ mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages landslide
  (landslide)$ pip install landslide

Check out the Six Feet Up Landslide theme::

  $ cd presentations/
  $ git clone git@github.com:sixfeetup/sixfeetup_landslide.git sixfeetup

Create
------

Create a folder for your new presentation::

  $ mkdir sample
  $ cd sample
  $ touch slides.md

Edit the new markdown file to build your presentation.

Once you have written the markdown, convert the file into HTML. Inside the sixfeetup theme is a config file that contains all the options for building the presentation. You may need to edit this file first, to properly update the path to the sixfeetup theme.

**NOTE**: until a bug (https://github.com/adamzap/landslide/issues/93) in `landslide` is fixed, we have to pass `-c` / `--copy-theme` on the command line::

  $ workon landslide
  (landslide)$ landslide -c ../sixfeetup/sixfeetup.cfg

The config file comes with options preset for name of destination file, embedding base-64 images, using relative links, copying the theme, and displaying code and line numbers in a table. Any of these can be changed to your preference, and https://github.com/adamzap/landslide lists additional options.

You can now view the `index.html` that was created in a browser, or put your `sample` folder on the web. 

Edit the HTML file to change the footer text to have your name and event. These will ideally get put into variables in the future.
